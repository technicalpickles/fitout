# npm Name Alternatives

## Context

The name `fettle` is taken on npm by a health dashboard project. Currently using `@technicalpickles/fettle` as a scoped package.

## Followup

Look for alternative unscoped names that:
- Are available on npm
- Relate to the plugin manager concept
- Are memorable and easy to type

### Ideas to explore

- Plugin-related: `plugwise`, `plugctl`, `plugsync`
- Claude-related: `claude-plugins`, `claudectl`
- State/sync-related: `statesync`, `configsync`
- Wordplay on "fettle": `fettler`, `infettle`

### Criteria

- Short (ideally <10 chars)
- Easy to spell
- Not confusable with existing tools
- Available on npm and GitHub
